1. what if send and recv function fail?

2. what if send and recv function fail to send and recv all the messages in one time?

2/24/2023

1. we need to add '\0' when relaying message from client to server in POST request

2. forgetting to close client socket in the proxy(pHttpClient->fd in my code) would lead to unexpected errors

2/25/2023

1. for a GET request with max-stale header, how should we log?

2. sometimes we can't use recv==0 to check if sender has sent all the messages, because it will stick there and we need to
calculate whether it has sent all

1. don't use striptime and mktime in the <ctime>, it's mysterious and peculiar

1. There's a possibility that even we lock all the operations in the cache, extreme case is that
one thread can first find msg in the cache but later it's deleted by another thread because cache is full


Failures Handled:

1. In CONNECT request, I printed the communication process out and found client didn't respond to our proxy's 200 OK message.
It turned out that our proxy's 200 OK message had a wrong format. We need to add two "\r\n" after the content.

2. In CONNECT request, when I opened twitter.com. It showed "Secure Connection Failed".
Later we found we sent one message twice to the other end of the connection tunnel and we fixed it.

3. In POST request, it took a long time for the original server to respond.
We added '\0' to the POST request sent by the client and then relayed to server. After that, the original server responds fast.

4. In POST request, after the first submission of POST form, we found we couldn't go back and resubmitted (it's always loading)
We forgot to close the socket to communicate with the client in proxy server and we later added code to fix it

5. In GET request, we couldn't open the website http://www.njrsks.net/. 
After printing the process, we found that the website sent a whole chunked message in only one time which contradicted our previous
comprehension of chunked message. We added code to handle such situation.

6. In GET request, we couldn't reopen the website http://www.njrsks.net/ after the first visit(We'd fixed bug 5). It would show a blank page.
We identified and fixed numerous bugs to solve this problem, including the malfunction of setDate, setMaxAge and setExpires 
in Response class, mistaken passed-in paremeter of setExpires and wrong return format of getWholeMsg function in Response class.

7. In GET request, we found that some server would send GET response of different formats than MDN, like sending Etag rather than ETag
We modified our Response class to accomodate for it. 

8. In GET request, we changed our code about time and chunked pic website threw an exception of substr out of range
we found that because chunked pic website sent back a response with its Expires being -1


Exception Guarantee:

1. LRUCache class is strong guarantee. We allow constructor to throw and propogate exception(strong guarantee) while other class functions are no-throw guarantee.

2. Request, Response, DateMap and Timeinfo class are no-throw exception guarantee. Response class could throw inside the parse function, but we used try-catch block.

3. Server and Client class are strong guarantee. Their constructor can throw exceptions, but they won't cause serious problems.

4. handlerHelper.cpp file includes many funcions, we handled possible error cases and return immediately. They are no-throw guarantee

5. handler.cpp includes one main handler function and three sub-hanlder functions, they provide no-throw guarantee

6. Proxy main function has strong exception guarantee. That stems from the strong exception guarantee of Server and LRUCache. If proxy.cpp fails 
(can't create server or LRUCache), the whole program will crash. It's reasonable because it's crucial for the normal operation of our proxy 
server. If we can't create server and cache successfully at the beginning, we should exit to let administrator know the problem. And once server
and cache are created successfully, there won't be any exception being thrown.
