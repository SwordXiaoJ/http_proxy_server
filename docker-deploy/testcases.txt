We used https://mockbin.org/ to generate the following specified response website
according to our demand.

To test with the following generated website, it’s recommended to use netcat in the notion to get only one request and catch the response.
Then you can directly see the returned response and the process printed out in the console. The printing info is long and detailed.
Therefore, it’s not recommended to directly set the firefox browser connected our 12345 port and see the console printed info 
(It would generate too much!).

The following is the ordinary website, now you can set the browser proxy port to 12345 and enter the following website to see 
if proxy server can give responses. It’ s recommended to close the browser’s local cache to test the. 

For firefox, the procedures to close local cache is as follows:
1.Open the Firefox browser.
2.In the address bar, type ‘about:config’ and press Enter.
3.In the search bar, type ‘browser.cache.disk.enable’ and press Enter.
4.Double click on the ‘browser.cache.disk.enable’ preference to set its value to ‘false’
5.In the search bar, type ‘browser.cache.memory.enable’ and press Enter.
6.Double click on the ‘browser.cache.memory.enable’ preference to set its value to ‘false’

Websites are as follows:  
(Don’t see the console at this time, there’s too much information printed. We do output certain GET request 
and responses and cache content to files other than logs. But for cache content, only submitting a form(i.e.
activate POST handler) would update the cache content(it's overwrite while other files are appending). These
files would be cleared every time you start the proxy server.)
